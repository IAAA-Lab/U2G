# UML 2 GeoPackage: alternative encoding for the INSPIRE ecosystem

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

GeoPackage may serve as an alternative or additional encoding for complex and large INSPIRE data sets. 
This Repository contains a [UML-to-GeoPackage encoding rule](GeoPackage/geopackage-encoding-rule.md) based on the results of [Action 2017.2 on alternative encodings](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=277742184).
The documents of this work are based on the repository [INSPIRE-MIF 2017.2](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2).

This Repository contains:

- [The encoding proposal](GeoPackage/geopackage-encoding-rule.md) (*status: draft; unions and hierarchies in progress*).
- Administrative Units - application schema "Administrative Units" ([UML Model](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/data-model/approved/r4618-ir/html/index.htm?goto=2:1:2:1:7106)) encoded in GeoPackage (avaliable as [SQL dump](GeoPackage/annex-I/administrative-units/au.sql))
